 let balance=200;
 balance="three hundred";
 console.log(balance*10); // output will be NAN

let age =20;
age ='twenty';
console.log(age); // here we try to fetch the data from backend , wanna print 20 number , as we updated the age with string number the javascript printed the string number this is the problem in js

let obj={
    name:'arpit',
    age:17
}
console.log(obj.height);// here we no keys related to the height yet in console it gave output undefined ,but it should give error in output in js, causing problem in debuging
